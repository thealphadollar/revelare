## About

I'm a videogame backend developer and love to work on ideas that create fun for others. Opensource, scalability,
developer operations, psychology, and philosophy are some of the topics that make my eyes sparkle <img class="emoji" title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20">.
I enjoy meeting new people - learning from everyone, and enjoying the company. I like living a slow-paced life observing
the environment around me and getting fascinated everyday.

    In a nutshell, I'm a child inside excited to touch everything who codes decently.
