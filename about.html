## About

I'm a second year undergraduate in the department of Computer Science And Engineering at Indian Institute Of Technology Kharagpur. I love programming, writing poems, reading non-fiction and meeting new people. A fan of automation, I spend enough time automating mundane tasks so I have more for thinking and learning; you can have a look at my github profile for the projects!

In a nutshell, I'm an avid learner who's ambitions outgrow his blanket!
