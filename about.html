## About

I'm a backend developer and love to work on ideas that create values for mankind. Opensource, scalability, developer operations, psychology, and philosophy are some of the topics that make my eyes sparkle :sparkles:. I enjoy meeting new individuals, learning from everyone, and enjoying their company. I incline to observe and automate my environment so I can spend time thinking, learning, reading, and talking.

In a nutshell, I'm a coder after the sunset and everything by the sunrise.
