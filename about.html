## About

I'm a second year undergraduate in the department of Computer Science And Engineering at Indian Institute Of Kharagpur. I love programming, writing poems, reading and meeting new people. A fan of automation, I spend enough time automating mundane tasks so I have more for thinking and learning.

In a nutshell, I'm an avid learner who's ambitions outgrow his blanket!
