author_blurb: "Your typical geek; Shivam can be found toiling hard through books (away from library) to find what she means by her actions
 :wink: Hard at work, and harder at drunk dancing, he loves to skim through articles to increase his productivity so he can
 waste more time. Nonetheless, when he does get some time, and is in the mood, he writes few lines of code and more lines of rhymes :facepunch:"
