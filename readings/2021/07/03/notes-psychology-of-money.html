            <p>I recently finished reading <strong><em>The Psychology of Money</em></strong> by <em>Morgan Housel</em>. It is a fantastic book which talks about finance from a psychological perspective rather than technical. This aspect makes it more relatable and applicable when reading. Following are my notes from the book.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/notes-psychology-of-money/feature.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>A genius is a man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing their minds - Napolean.</li>
  <li>Money should be studied like psychology, and not physics, maths, etc.</li>
  <li>Our experience with money makes very little of how money behaves but most of how we think it works.</li>
  <li>Each individual’s view of money can be drastically different - our past experiences dictate how we see money (mostly).</li>
  <li>Our risk appetite is based on our experience with risk and luck in the past.</li>
  <li>All financial decision a person takes makes sense to them; no one’s crazy!</li>
  <li>The world is too complex to allow 100% of our actions to dictate 100% of the outcomes.</li>
  <li>In anyone’s success and failure give luck due respect. Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.</li>
  <li>Luck is mostly neglected since we want to take credit and our brains prefer simpler black and white answers.</li>
  <li>The line between “inspiringly bold” and “foolishly reckless” can be very thin and only visible in hindsight.</li>
  <li>Focus on broad patterns than particular individuals (say Elon Musk) or extreme examples. People with more time are happier is a broad pattern.</li>
  <li>Always leave room for failures - invest such that wrong decisions don’t wipe out entire wealth.</li>
  <li>Either it’s enough today or never.</li>
  <li>It is dangerous when ambitions outpace satisfaction. So, get the goalpost to stop moving.</li>
  <li>The ceiling of social comparison is infinite - the only way to win is to not participate.</li>
  <li>Enough is the realization that an insatiable appetite certainly leads to regrets.</li>
  <li>It is important to know when to stop otherwise harm comes to important parts of life - friends, family, respect, freedom, etc.</li>
  <li>If something compounds - a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary that they seem to defy logic.</li>
  <li>Time is the only important ingredient in compounding.</li>
  <li>The danger is the temptation to abandon compounding as it’s not apparent and look for other ways. So, shut up and wait!</li>
  <li>A good investment is earning good returns and repeating for a long time.</li>
  <li>Getting money and keeping money are drastically difficult skills.</li>
  <li>The only way to stay wealthy is a combination of frugality and paranoia.</li>
  <li>The ability to stick around for long enough is crucial - for compounding to work.</li>
  <li>We can’t assume yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good future. Hence, avoid ruin at all costs.</li>
  <li>More than big returns it’s important to be financially unbreakable.</li>
  <li>Planning on things not going according to plan is important. Hence, emergency funds, insurances, etc.</li>
  <li>A mixture of optimism about the future and paranoia about what’ll stop us from getting there is important.</li>
  <li>Destruction in the face of progress can be an efficient way to get rid of excess.</li>
  <li>Short-term paranoia helps exploit long-term optimism.</li>
  <li>We can be wrong most of the time and still end up making fortune - the world is driven by tails.</li>
  <li>We should avoid overreacting since it is normal for things to fail.</li>
  <li>Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, influential is most likely a result of a tail event.</li>
  <li>Our success as an investor is determined by how we respond to punctuated moments of terror, not years of cruise control.</li>
  <li>The highest dividend money can pay is control over our time.</li>
  <li>Using money to buy time and options has lifestyle benefits few luxury goods can provide.</li>
  <li>Doing something we love on a schedule that we can’t control can feel the same as doing something we don’t like.</li>
  <li>Buying expensive things to gain respect and admiration never works. Humility, kindness, and empathy bring more respect and admiration.</li>
  <li>Spending money to show people how much money we have is the quickest way to lose money.</li>
  <li>Wealth is what we don’t see. However, we judge wealth by what we see since that’s simpler.</li>
  <li>The way to be rich is to spend judiciously the money we have and never spend the money we don’t have. It’s hard and requires self-control.</li>
  <li>Building wealth has little to do with our income or investment returns, and lots to do with our savings rate.</li>
  <li>Learning to be happier with less money is like getting a higher paycheck - only easier and in our control.</li>
  <li>More humility, more saving. More ego, more spending.</li>
  <li>We should save just for the sake of saving. Every bit of saving is buying freedom in the future.</li>
  <li>The intangible value of money surpasses its purchasing power. Sadly, we overlook what we can’t measure.</li>
  <li>Being mostly reasonable is better than being coldly rational.</li>
  <li>It is easier to stick with reasonable decisions for a long time.</li>
  <li>Make financial decisions to sleep well at night and minimize future regrets.</li>
  <li>There are few financial variables more correlated to performance than the commitment to a strategy during its lean years.</li>
  <li>Things that have never happened before happen all the time.</li>
  <li>Over-reliance on past data as a signal to future conditions is a trap when innovation and change drive the field.</li>
  <li>Do not engage in the over-admiration of people who have been there, done that when it comes to financing.</li>
  <li>Experience may lead to overconfidence more than forecasting abilities.</li>
  <li>When relying too much on the past, we may overlook the tail events.</li>
  <li>Realizing the future might not look anything like the past is a special skill.</li>
  <li>History can be misleading since it doesn’t account for contemporary structures and processes.</li>
  <li>The further back we look into history, the more general should be our takeaways.</li>
  <li>The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance are ever-present.</li>
  <li>A way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what we think will happen and what can happen while still leaving us capable of fighting another day.</li>
  <li>The margin of safety is the only effective way to navigate a world that is governed by odds, not certainties.</li>
  <li>Two false ideas that cause us to avoid room for error are:
    <ul>
      <li>believing somebody knows what the future holds</li>
      <li>thinking we are doing ourselves harm by not exploiting the “known” accurate version of the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aim for enduring what’s emotionally possible &amp; not just technically feasible when making room for error.</li>
  <li>Attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable is dangerous. For eg. thinking that Russian Roulette will favor us.</li>
  <li>We should take risks to get ahead but never risks that can completely wipe us out.</li>
  <li>A good rule of thumb is if anything can break it’ll break. So, avoid single points of failure.</li>
  <li>Long-term planning is harder than it seems since our goals and desires change over time.</li>
  <li>We are poor forecasters of our future self.</li>
  <li>We should avoid extreme ends of financial planning and everything in general.</li>
  <li>Balance at every point of life is a strategy to avoid future regret and increase our endurance.</li>
  <li>We should accept the reality of changing our minds - have no sunk costs!</li>
  <li>Everything has a price but not all prices appear on labels.</li>
  <li>Things are harder in practice as we’re not good at identifying what the price of success is.</li>
  <li>Like everything else, the higher the returns the higher the price i.e. risks and volatility.</li>
  <li>Thinking of market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that lets us stick for long.</li>
  <li>Always find the price, then pay it. Don’t wait for the bill to get overdue.</li>
  <li>Beware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than we are.</li>
  <li>In hindsight, we are more likely to point to cynical figures than to learn lessons.</li>
  <li>A rile of thumb - money chases returns to the greatest extent possible.</li>
  <li>Bubble forms when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long-term to mostly short-term.</li>
  <li>It’s hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than us because it is non-intuitive to accept that rational people can see the world through a different lens.</li>
  <li>It’s important to identify the game we are playing and not get persuaded by the actions of people playing a different game.</li>
  <li>Optimism sounds like a sales pitch. Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help us.</li>
  <li>Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in our favor even when there will be setbacks along the way.</li>
  <li>Tell someone they are in danger and we’ve their undivided attention.</li>
  <li>Money is ubiquitous, so something bad happening tends to affect everyone and capture attention.</li>
  <li>Pessimists often extrapolate present trends without accounting for how markets adapt.</li>
  <li>Problems correct and people adapt. Threats incentivize solutions in equal magnitude.</li>
  <li>Progress happens slowly to notice, setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.</li>
  <li>Appealing fiction &amp; stories are more powerful than statistics.</li>
  <li>Narrative (story) damage is one of the most potent economic forces.</li>
  <li>The more we want something to be true, the more likely we are to believe a story overestimating the odds of it being true.</li>
  <li>An appealing fiction happens when we are smart, we want to find solutions, but face a combination of limited control and high stakes.</li>
  <li>The larger the room for error, the more protected we are from falling victim to appealing fiction.</li>
  <li>Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. However, we form a complete narrative to fill the gaps.</li>
  <li>Coming to terms with how much we don’t know means coming to terms with how much is out of our control. That is a hard pill to swallow.</li>
  <li>Risk is what’s left over when we think we’ve thought of everything.</li>
  <li>The illusion of control is more persuasion than the reality of uncertainty.</li>
  <li>We suggest what makes sense but do what feels right.</li>
  <li>When dealing with complicated emotional issues, there is no one right answer.</li>
  <li>True success is existing some rat race to modulate our activities for peace of mind.</li>
  <li>Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point,j we’ve to choose between being happy and being right.</li>
  <li>Everyone without exception eventually faces a huge expense they didn’t expect. So, plan emergencies.</li>
  <li>Beating the market should be hard. If it wasn’t everyone would do it and if everyone did it then there would be no opportunity.</li>
</ul>

              I'm intrigued by human psychology and code backend for videogames. I live with a philosophy to be simple, true, and kind always. I enjoy taking days slowly and writing when I learn something new - ah! that reminds me, I enjoy learning from new experiences a lot.
