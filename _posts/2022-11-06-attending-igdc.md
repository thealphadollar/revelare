This is a write up after long time - it was the news of leaving Mercari that I shared the last. Since then, after going through a tough phase of anxiety (a tale for another post), I've shifted to being a videogame backend developer at LILA Games. Being very new to the gaming ecosystem in India, I attended the IGDC this year - with suport from LILA Games.

Before writing down my experience it is important to clear that - I'm so new to the game dev scene in India that I often look at it through the perspective of core software development I had been doing. The perspective alongwith my recency into game development is a huge factor into my first IGDC experience.

## Perspective

Not long ago, I was working at Mercari Japan - as a software engineer on their C2C app. Building apps that serve a purpose for the users and building games that are to be fun for the users - are poles apart in their concept. Or that's how I felt - and I needed to understand better. Not be in a silo - breathing the same thoughts as earlier and tryongto produce something new. Beinf the only backend developer at the company didn't help much - I could get the perspective from artists and designers, but to onlyu a certain extent . I need to understand how people were building multiplauer games, what technologies ther were using, how were the optimizing, and more about the techncal challenges I can expect. While I was having those questions in muy mind, a WhatsApp message popped,

> Hyderabad chalega, IGDC ke liye?

Aha! I talked with Avinash and he was all in - it was warm to see them pushing me for having more eposure to the field; and while they emphasized IGDC is not always worth attending, it is definitely worth it the first time! So, I didn't look back, booked my tickets, informed my friends, and there I was at the IGDC on 3rd November 2022!

## First Day; The Expo

I dropped off at Hyderbad around 8 in the morning - a calm city where I could book Rapido bikes in an instant and did't find traffic, a refreshing experience after living in Bangalore for sometime. The registration was to close by 10:30 AM, so I hurried and left for the venue.

Reaching almost on time, my first realization was... HICC is huge! And it was painful since I ended up reaching the backgate- that was closed. Somehow, I made it to the entry and then like a curious cat, jumped right into the Expo hall. Firstly, I was surprised by the number of institutions that have come up to provide training for a career in gaming - the only one I was aware of during my school days (and probably it was the only one in existence back around 2015s) is *Backstage Pass School of Gaming*. There were games in different categories - from top-view racing games to TPP adventures - being developed by students. Seeing the passion and excitement filled me with hope that, in India, game development and gaming are only going to boom with better talent in the future (a perspective shared by Avinash, our CTO, as well).

There were booths with games, technologies, devices all around! _Rockstar_, _Unreal_, _Ogre Head Studios_ - you name the known gaming studios of India, and they were there. Indian Mythology was a major theme for games at the Expo - with Indian cultural remake of famous AAA games (like GTA) being a close second. Art and concepts were the strong aspects of all the games that were there - with _Yodha_ by _Ogre Head Studios_ standing out with it's small team and good grasp on visual effects. Strangely, small teams isn't limited to a few studios - most of the games had a small passionate team of individuals working on them. I sense that primarily it is passion - while low risk taking is a close factor as most of the projects seemed bootstrapped rather than funded. Having said that, sitting through the panels made me feel the funding scenario will change soon for the Indian gaming sector.

## The Talks (& Panels)

Talking of panels and the talks at the IGDC, most of them were new to me. Having only attended technical conferences in my life - the talks sounded different to me. I'm used to having technical details and code snippets in the talks, and here it was mostly text and talk, even in the sessions I expected to be technical. Skipping the sessions that were around art, design, and career in gaming (80% of the talks, BTW), I felt the sessions could have been better.

In talks that were being presented by established game development companies (likes of _Rockstar_ and _Ubisoft_), they seemed to cling strongly to the idea of protecting their IP, technical tools, and present "miracles" - probably they wanted to attract engineers to interesting challenges and not reveal how they solve the challenges. For instance, I remember one of the talks that was about using testing in games - somewhat similar to unit-testing. Shifting from manual tests to automated testing of game features using scripts had helped them reduce test iteration time from tens of hours to a few hours. However, only the "what we achieved" was presented and now how we went along the way. As a developer, I would already know tests help develop and iterate faster without breaking existing code - what I would be interested in is what process and tools a development team used to achieve the results and how they solved the challenges that they encountered, what were the tradeoffs and more. I heard a similar review for sessions in Art & Design by big names.

> The above doesn't imply all technical talks were the same; there were detailed ones as well on Unity URP, Memory Benchmarking, etc. by independent developers.

Panels were interesting - everything I heard was new (and hopeful) to me; the gaming scenario in India, how is the future scope, what is it like having a career in gaming, and how to be a top ten percent in the game development industry. I was especially intrigued by the talks that showed how new technologies such as 5G, advancements in machine learning, etc., are going to change the way games are developed - though fundamentally keeping how fun the game is at the core. A tiny distinction from previous technical panels that I have attended, I felt a lack of humbleness and ability to say "I don't know" for topics that were new and had no homework done on by the panelists.

## Networking

The inability to accept lack of understanding of a certain topic, especially technical (as that's the only aspect I know a bit about), seemed to stem from a thought I came across the last day, roaming around the booths presenting technologies. Taking on the good part first, I was amazed to see *The Gaming Project*, a service similar to Google Stadia (that closed down earlier this year TODO: add link). They seemed to have cracked down on the problem of latency and delivering gaming experience over the internet without installation - and the demo was sleek. I also came across AppSealing, a service that provides SDK to protect games from client side hacks - interesting and crucial piece of technology that, if it lives up to its promises, every application with freemium model would want it.

Over to some of the less exciting technologies, I came across few technologies that promise a lot of buzz words with few tricks up their sleeve - and these tricks can be implemented by a developer as well with willingness to understand the underlying technology. 

## Everything Else
