description: Just a month back, I wrote about my one year experience at Mercari. I had no idea that would be my final experience as well - yes! I left Mercari on 30th June after working as a Software Engineer (Overseas Contractor) in the User Master Program team for over an year. It was a tough call - and I had to make it!

Just a month back, I wrote about [my one-year experience at Mercari](https://thealphadollar.me/experience/2022/06/01/mercari-experience-one-year.html). I had no idea that would be my final experience as well - yes! I left Mercari on 30th June after working as a Software Engineer (Overseas Contractor) in the User Master Program team for over a year. It was a tough call - and I had to make it!

## Why I Left Mercari?

Recently, Mercari opened an office in Bangalore, India. I was excited to join the India office - however, the compensation benchmarks we had placed my package at a very low bracket (my personal views). According to my experience and analysis of the offers received by graduates at my University, it would have been unjust for me to join the company. At the same time, starting CTC is one of the most important aspects which decides how increments follow.

Not accepting the JP offer where the package was amazing - it's more of indecision than a decision. I've started to feel that I need family and friends around to keep myself motivated in life. I'm someone very susceptible to loneliness and meaninglessness. I'm not sure if I can be mentally well in Japan - where it is very convenient yet secluded. I would prefer a work environment where I can make friends among my co-workers - which is a strict no-no in Japan. Staying in India will also allow me to stay closer to my family and friends. So, scared of deteriorating my mental health, I didn't accept the Mercari JP offer.

I have worked hard to get an offer from Mercari JP and it's scary to let it go. However, working in India provides the opportunity to connect with people (you are working with) and outside, which I would like to do apart from my working hours. I feel I'm tired of following one goal after another - I want to take it easy, chill and enjoy life.

## Where Am I Joining Next?

I don't know!

At the moment, I'll be studying Competitive Programming, DBMS, OS, etc. In parallel, I've also started interviews with companies. So, let's see where I go.

The most fun part - I've started to look for what I like and the first contender is Gaming (apart from just chilling with friends). Gaming, in fact, brought me to programming in my 8th standard - and I guess it's time to touch back the roots.
