As soon as I finished reading ["The Difficulty Of Being Good"](https://thealphadollar.github.io/readings/2018/08/25/book-review-3.html),
I started off with a small read "The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck". It is, without doubt, one of the most criticised as well as praised book.
The book is a small read, and since it revolves around a single agenda, the review is going to be small and mostly filled with
personal views.

The language used in the book is simple and to the point, and at times crude. The author has used curses and, at times insults to emphasize
the points and lessons he wants us to take into account. I personally do not find any harm in using the language but, others may find it
inappropriate for a book that promises (and mostly lives up to) the point of uplifting you mentally and giving less reasons to get tensed. It is anything but your typical all good and glory self-help.

> self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head.

The author has divided the content into chapters which are in sync with each and create the feeling of level handling; "you first have to light the match to 
burn candles". With the end of each chapter I would stop to ponder if I had known (and thought consciously about) everything the
author mentions in the section how much suffering I could have avoided. And with each chapter, this self-contemplation grew
stronger.

Amidst the regular conversational method of conveyance, enough examples have been included. They add to the level of involvement:
providing motivation (and incentive) to read further along with the weight of authenticity of the words written around it.

There isn't much to be said about the book except that it's a very relatable and no-nonsense read, and if you've got a weekend free,
it's worth giving a shot at. It brings to the surface, and in a way reminds us of what's worthy of being concerned about and what all crap we
actually are bothered with.
