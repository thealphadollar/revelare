It is an universal desire in each of us to form deep relations with other fellow humans but we always forget
that relations we form are breathing organisms that need nurturing and growth to sustain themselves.

I was quite, like any amateur, struggling in my interactions with other people and I got myself to sit and read
what "others" have thought about relations and how their experience can help me grow better in my own life.

Disclaimer:  This book is not just for romantic relations but for interaction with other people.

> Relationships in broad perspective.

The first book I took was a mediocre one and I was not expecting much from it. It is the "Neu-Code for 
Winning Relationships" by Bindu Bhatia. A funny incident that happened just after I started reading the book was the below image.

On seeing this, my friend was convinced that this book must be no more than another from the file of no-use self help books; but
to judge an author's content by her choice in actors would be too hard I decided. So, in spite of the opposition and criticism,
I begun with the book.

The book is light on content and heavy on words; I found out that to emphasize on facts and phrases, the book used
repetition heavily. This was annoying to me since it's kind of forceful reinforcement: if there is some part I'd like to 
make myself understand better, I would prefer to have the choice rather than it being pushed down my throat.

The book is divided into multiple chapters, which have appropriately curated headings but, as I mentioned earlier, there are 
repetitive stuff spanning across multiple chapters.

The most remarkable achievement of the author is her ability to mix established psychology with her own views and "facts" and sell
it with authenticity. It is not to say that this lowers the quality of the book or it's lessons, but definitely gives cringe moments.

The chapters are also well summarised at the end of each, and there are mind tasks to be done by the reader. The author pitches
that to fully understand a lesson one must complete the tasks and indeed, they help get further clarity regarding what we are 
doing and give a sense of connection between practicality and literature.

The book talks about relations, disputes and practices by which we can improve the quality of our relations but fails to convince me
regarding the authenticity and viability. Sometimes I do get the feel of the thought (asked to focus on) making a change in my
life in coming times but mostly the other stuff seems preaching to me.

The book is well written with moments of disappointment but, after reading other books on my list (reviews will come later),
I'd definitely say that this one should be skipped. It talks more on emotions and pseudo-psychology than practicality.
