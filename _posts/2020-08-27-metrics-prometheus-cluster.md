I recently had to setup metrics monitoring for a `node.js` application that I have been running using PM2 clusters. This article provides an approach to do the same and I believe should be helpful to anyone wanting to collect metrics and setup grafana dashboard for their application which uses [PM2 as a process manager](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and runs in [cluster mode]((https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/)).

> PM2 is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online 24/7

Before we begin, one should have basic idea about the meaning and usage of the following technologies and terms:

0. Node.js and express
1. PM2 process manager
2. Metrics
3. Docker
4. REST API
5. IP Address

## The Issue
So, where does the problem lie? Why can't we simply setup metrics for the application like any other node.js application metrics? We can if we want to use proprietary and paid tool; for instance [pm2-io-apm](https://github.com/keymetrics/pm2-io-apm), which is designed specifically for PM2. However, if you are like me and falling towards the opensource side, read further!

> Instance refers to a single running worker of the application.

In PM2 clustering, all the instances of the application are running separately with PM2 as the master process, right? So, now when we sent a request to get metrics, PM2 allocates the request to a single instance which will provide us with it's own metrics and not the aggregated metrics of all the instances that are currently running. This will give metrics of only one of the instance at a time and it'll be changing randomly with every request made to the metrics endpoint. Isn't that an issue?
## Setting Up Metrics On An Instance Basis
The first step towards setting up metrics for our application, is installing the appropriate libraries. We'll be using [express-prom-bundle](https://github.com/jochen-schweizer/express-prom-bundle) and [graphql-metrics](https://github.com/McJug/graphql-metrics#readme). Below is the code that is required to be setup for the express app,

> I've only shown imports pertaining to the two libraries I've mentioned above, there could be other imports required as well.

<pre><code data-trim class="js">
{% raw %}
import promBundle from 'express-prom-bundle';
import createMetricsPlugin from 'apollo-metrics';

const app = express();
// metrics for graphql requests
const apolloMetricsPlugin = createMetricsPlugin(register);
// metrics for rest requests
app.use(
    promBundle({
        autoregister: false, // disable /metrics for single workers
        includeMethod: true,
        includeStatusCode: true,
        includePath: true,
        promRegistry: register,
    }),
);
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

The important step here is using the same `promRegistry` for both the middlewares so that their metrics are together. Also, it is important to set `autoRegister` to `False` since we do not want the `/metrics` endpoint to be created by `promBundle`.

> Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 

## Aggregating Metrics From All Instances
Now, since we have setup metrics on a per instance basis, we move on to the aggregation part. Remember we did not create the `/metrics` endpoint earlier? We will create it now and send aggregated metrics from all processes using the library [pm2-cluster-prometheus](https://github.com/JakeH/pm2-cluster-prometheus). Following code is the updated code with the use of the library.

<pre><code data-trim class="js">
{% raw %}
const app = express();
const aggregatorRegistry = new AggregatorRegistry();
// register for prometheus aggregation
app.get('/metrics', async (_, res) => {
    const metrics = await getAggregateMetrics();
    res.set('Content-Type', aggregatorRegistry.contentType);
    res.send(metrics.metrics());
});
// metrics for graphql requests
const apolloMetricsPlugin = createMetricsPlugin(register);
// metrics for rest requests
app.use(
    promBundle({
        autoregister: false, // disable /metrics for single workers
        includeMethod: true,
        includeStatusCode: true,
        includePath: true,
        promRegistry: register,
    }),
);
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

That's it! Now the metrics that we get from `/metrics` is the aggregated metrics from all the instances using the default [prometheus registry](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client#multiple-registries). This aggregation has a limitation that it can only aggregate from default registry and therefore cannot be used with libraries (for example [swagger-stats](https://github.com/slanatech/swagger-stats)) which don't allow setting register and use their own register and endpoint.

> A GitHub issue has been raised for swagger-stats regarding the same, [#114](https://github.com/slanatech/swagger-stats/issues/114)

NOTE: I'm not sure about the fact that aggregation is only possible from default registry, however I've not found any example or documentation saying otherwise.
## Setting Up Prometheus & Grafana
Having made available the aggregated metrics from our instances, it is time to setup Prometheus and Grafana. The process is very straighforward using <em>[dockprom](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom)</em>.  One should be familiar with how to install Docker and follow the instructions laid down in the readme for rest of the process.

> dockprom is a monitoring solution for Docker hosts and containers with Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor, NodeExporter and alerting with AlertManager.

Once we have the docker containers running, we need to add the following configuration under `scrape_configs` in `prometheus/prometheus.yml` which would allow prometheus to pull metrics from our application.

<pre><code data-trim class="text">
{% raw %}
- job_name: APP_NAME
  scrape_interval: 5s
  scrape_timeout: 5s
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['YOUR_INTERNAL_IP:5000'] // assuming application is running on port 5000
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

`YOUR_INTERNAL_IP` is the IP address of your machine which the prometheus docker-container can use to access the `/metrics` endpoint. This can be either your global IP address or the IP address alloted to your machine on the network. The command `ip address` when run in terminal gives the information about all the network devices and associated IP address. As an example, below is the address I would have put when running in my machine.

For Grafana, I've create a dashboard (shown below) which shows basic information about the application. You can find the configuration for the dashboard in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jochen-schweizer/express-prom-bundle/issues/40#issuecomment-682058054) and download the JSON and add it in the folder `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`.

## Conclusion
There are multiple other methods to achieve the same, and some of them have been added in the next section. I tried almost all the existing methods before using aggregator as, unfortunately, none of them worked for me. If it is useful to you, which I believe it will be since you are using PM2 clustering, for resources level metrics I found [pm2-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/saikatharryc/pm2-prometheus-exporter) really useful and it has a [dashboard](https://github.com/saikatharryc/pm2-prometheus-exporter/issues/1#issuecomment-499551831) as well :smile:

Do give your feedback so that I can make the article much more useful and clear!
