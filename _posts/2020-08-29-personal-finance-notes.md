[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a great source of learning and I'm thankful for the addition of the section named "[Life Skills](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more)" lately. The section contains short courses on significant topics that are amiss in college and school education vis-Ã -vis personal finance, college admissions, careers, and entrepreneurship.

This writeup contains notes that I made while learning[ Personal Finance](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance) from the same set of courses; it is a highly recommended series for individuals who are looking to start as a layman into the world of managing their money and living through less stressful finances.

## [Saving and budgeting](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-saving-and-budgeting)
- **Never ignore thinking about finances**; it's tempting to ignore it because we fear our financial limitations and want that fancy car!
- Live sustainably, **live below your means**!
- **Optimize expenditure** to gain financial freedom, and spend towards experiences like spending more time with family.
- At the beginning as a new grad out on a job, it is very tempting to spend extravagantly and get that fancy flat - **the excitement wears off in a month and stress kicks in** of paying the loans and EMIs.
- Aim to **save first and then buy** that commodity - avoid loans, EMIs, and other entities that charge interest.
- **Don't struggle and stress to own more liabilities** - have the mindset of spending money on bringing peace and happiness for longterm rising above living from paycheck to paycheck.
- **Marriage is one of the most important financial decisions** - financial compatibility and similar values of the partners is very much required, one cannot be wanting to spend lavishly and other saving.
- **Teach children about financial stress** and "can we afford this?" - it is very NOT obvious in the contemporary plastic money era how buying functions.
- **Explain lucidly to children when they ask financial questions** like "can we get unlimited money from ATM" - helps in making them comfortable with talking about money (which is otherwise considered as taboo as talking about menstruation and sex).
- Talk to children and **get them thinking about taxes**, how it works, who pays for the roads, and where taxes go - in general about how the economy works.
- **Talk openly about money with parents** - understand their buying habits, financial stresses, and budget tips.
- **Plan for long term expenditures** like child's college and INVEST each month - [example calculation for college fees](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-saving-and-budgeting/pf-perspectives-for-families-tutorial/v/math-behind-saving-for-college2?modal=1).
- **Track and manage spending** in the following manner:
	0. list monthly recurring payments
	1. necessary expenditures like grocery
	2. set up automatic payments for recurring and savings
	3. remember "envelope method"
	4. use money management tools
- **Pay credit card charges in full**.
- Three simple **principles of an efficient monthly budget**:
	- make sure needs are covered
	- manage debts and savings
	- avoid overspending
- Important **steps to create a budget**:
	0. Note your net income (total - taxes)
	1. track spending
	2. set short-term and long-term goals
	3. make a plan separating needs and wants
	4. adjust spending habits if necessary, shedding from want-to-haves then need-to-haves
	5. setup reminder to review the budget monthly
	6. remember small savings add up to large in the long run
- **Create an emergency savings fund** to pass by 6-9 months. The fund should be able to cover:
	- housing
	- food
	- insurance and debt
	- transportation
	- personal needs
- Put away **tax refunds, bonuses, etc. in emergency savings** and also regularly add savings till the desired amount is reached.
- Decide wisely **where to store and invest the emergency savings**.
- **Find small habits to save money in the long-run**. Some habits can be:
	- making your coffee, lunch, meals, etc.
	- stay healthy by riding a bicycle to work
	- create a list of things to buy beforehand and leverage sales and coupons
	- be wary of psychological tricks at times of sales and discounts, do not overspend
	- be selective in what's important like brands and quality
	- plan meals ahead of time
	- save by using electricity during non-peak hours
	- avoid spontaneous extravagant spending with friends, plan outing beforehand
- **Create a list of items you need to buy and contemplate** over the same before you decide to buy - most of the items would get removed from the list in a week or two.
- **Analyze spending and find unique ways to save costs** to create large corpus over time.
- Set aside **dedicated 1-2 hours each month to analyze, save on (find good deals?), and pay bills**. Following are some techniques to reduce bills
	- always negotiate and cut extras like unwatched channels
	- pay extensive attention to the details of phone bill
	- save on house by negotiating
	- use electricity very wisely and during non-peak hours
	- be smart in choosing insurances and review them regularly - research is very important

> **The aim of saving money is to use that money to enjoy pleasures such as going on a vacation, gifting your children that PS4, etc. DO NOT SAVE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF SAVING**!
