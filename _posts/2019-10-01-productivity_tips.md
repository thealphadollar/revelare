I recently read Sam Altman's guide to productivity. It is approximately a 10 minutes read so I'm putting summary of it below as a quick notes essay. These methods also put to test his claims of being more productive than average; where definitely *average* is debatable.

> Samuel H. "Sam" Altman is an American entrepreneur, investor, programmer, and blogger. He is the chairman of Y Combinator and co-chairman of OpenAI.

His tips as a bulleted summary are:

1. We should focus on compound growth: **1% better everyday** compounded for 10 years **is absurdly huge**.
2. Picking **what you work on is crucial**, and we only get better at choices with time.
3. Leave **enough time** in our schedule **to decide what we work on**.
4. Delegate, avoid or do anything to **not do things we don't want to**.
5. **Make everyone** in team **efficient** by asking them to do what they love.
6. Short-terms **burnouts are acceptable** but **not** repeated ones.
7. Will I be ready to do *it* for free? If yes, I love it. But **shouldn't go and start doing it for free**! :wink:
8. We can **learn anything we want** to; it's **NOT A MIRACLE**.
9. **Be around people who push** us and are ambitious; avoid the opposite kind.
10. We need to be both **smart and hard-working** to achieve big goals.
11. Work on three pillars: make sure to **get important shit done**, **don't waste time** on stupid shit, **make a lot of lists** for what you want to do for the day, week, year [but don't be insane!]
12. Prioritize in a way that generates** momentum**; to begin **is half work done**.
13. Be **ruthless about saying no** to non-critical stuff and get away with them quickly.
14. **Avoiding meetings** and conferences can **help in saving a lot of time**; most meeting should be either 10-20 minutes or 2 hours.
15. Keeping an **open network is highly helpful**, thought most of it will be waste but rest make up.
16. **Don't schedule** anything **in the most productive hours** of our day.
17. Choose to **spend $100 and improve**, than to save $20; see point 1.
18. Chasing productivity for it's own sake is like *eating your own tail*.
19. Find **physical habits to bring out the best mood** in ourselves: the best time to get up, best sleeping habits, invest in stuff to keep you relaxed easily.
20. Have a **no-interruption** work environment.
21. Learn to **automate** your **mundane tasks**.
22. Going through **a week** or so **of unwillingness to work is fine**; optimal year is the goal, not day.
23. Avoid people and situations which put us in bad mood.
24. **Overcommiting** a bit** at times is helpful** in pushing ourselves.
 
The most important of all, in my opinion, is 

> **Never neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity.**

Neglecting them would cause you to be unhappy and there by reducing your productivity in the long run; remember **optimal year is the goal**, not day!

The original article can be found [here](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity). The above is my take from the article and a lot of it has been customized to fit in my personal life. I, personally believe, that it is very important to try to optimise our lives and the work environment, and my motivation for the same is to have more time to spend with friends and family with improving output.
