[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a great source of learning and I'm thankful for the addition of the section named "[Life Skills](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more)" lately. The section contains short courses on significant topics that are amiss in college and school education vis-Ã -vis personal finance, college admissions, careers, and entrepreneurship.

![Unlock Financial Freedom](/img/posts/personal-finance-notes/feature.gif)

This writeup contains notes that I made while learning[ Personal Finance](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance) from the same set of courses; it is a highly recommended series for individuals who are looking to start as a layman into the world of managing their money and living through less stressful finances.

## [Saving and budgeting](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-saving-and-budgeting)
- **Never ignore thinking about finances**; it's tempting to ignore it because we fear our financial limitations and want that fancy car!
- Live sustainably, **live below your means**!
- **Optimize expenditure** to gain financial freedom, and spend towards experiences like spending more time with family.
- At the beginning as a new grad out on a job, it is very tempting to spend extravagantly and get that fancy flat - **the excitement wears off in a month and stress kicks in** of paying the loans and EMIs.
- Aim to **save first and then buy** that commodity - avoid loans, EMIs, and other entities that charge interest.
- **Don't struggle and stress to own more liabilities** - have the mindset of spending money on bringing peace and happiness for longterm rising above living from paycheck to paycheck.
- **Marriage is one of the most important financial decisions** - financial compatibility and similar values of the partners is very much required, one cannot be wanting to spend lavishly and other saving.
- **Teach children about financial stress** and "can we afford this?" - it is very NOT obvious in the contemporary plastic money era how buying functions.
- **Explain lucidly to children when they ask financial questions** like "can we get unlimited money from ATM" - helps in making them comfortable with talking about money (which is otherwise considered as taboo as talking about menstruation and sex).
- Talk to children and **get them thinking about taxes**, how it works, who pays for the roads, and where taxes go - in general about how the economy works.
- **Talk openly about money with parents** - understand their buying habits, financial stresses, and budget tips.
- **Plan for long term expenditures** like child's college and INVEST each month - [example calculation for college fees](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-saving-and-budgeting/pf-perspectives-for-families-tutorial/v/math-behind-saving-for-college2?modal=1).
- **Track and manage spending** in the following manner:
	0. list monthly recurring payments
	1. necessary expenditures like grocery
	2. set up automatic payments for recurring and savings
	3. remember "envelope method"
	4. use money management tools
- **Pay credit card charges in full**.
- Three simple **principles of an efficient monthly budget**:
	- make sure needs are covered
	- manage debts and savings
	- avoid overspending
- Important **steps to create a budget**:
	0. Note your net income (total - taxes)
	1. track spending
	2. set short-term and long-term goals
	3. make a plan separating needs and wants
	4. adjust spending habits if necessary, shedding from want-to-haves then need-to-haves
	5. setup reminder to review the budget monthly
	6. remember small savings add up to large in the long run
- **Create an emergency savings fund** to pass by 6-9 months. The fund should be able to cover:
	- housing
	- food
	- insurance and debt
	- transportation
	- personal needs
- Put away **tax refunds, bonuses, etc. in emergency savings** and also regularly add savings till the desired amount is reached.
- Decide wisely **where to store and invest the emergency savings**.
- **Find small habits to save money in the long-run**. Some habits can be:
	- making your coffee, lunch, meals, etc.
	- stay healthy by riding a bicycle to work
	- create a list of things to buy beforehand and leverage sales and coupons
	- be wary of psychological tricks at times of sales and discounts, do not overspend
	- be selective in what's important like brands and quality
	- plan meals ahead of time
	- save by using electricity during non-peak hours
	- avoid spontaneous extravagant spending with friends, plan outing beforehand
- **Create a list of items you need to buy and contemplate** over the same before you decide to buy - most of the items would get removed from the list in a week or two.
- **Analyze spending and find unique ways to save costs** to create large corpus over time.
- Set aside **dedicated 1-2 hours each month to analyze, save on (find good deals?), and pay bills**. Following are some techniques to reduce bills
	- always negotiate and cut extras like unwatched channels
	- pay extensive attention to the details of phone bill
	- save on house by negotiating
	- use electricity very wisely and during non-peak hours
	- be smart in choosing insurances and review them regularly - research is very important

> **The aim of saving money is to use that money to enjoy pleasures such as going on a vacation, gifting your children that PS4, etc. DO NOT SAVE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF SAVING!**

## [Interest And Debt](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-interest-and-debt)
- **Compound interest is** magical and **psychologically deceiving** - remember every percentage point counts.
- **Rule of 72**: divide 72 by return percentage (compounding) to estimate the number of years it'll take to double the money.
- Interest is, in very simple terms, the rent on money taken or given.
- **Interest rates are dynamic** and fluctuate as *main bank* deems fit to keep the economy stable, inflation in check, and encourage the creation of jobs. The following examples explain better:
	- When the employment rate is low, interest rates are lowered to encourage taking more loans boosting purchase and economic activity and thus creating jobs.
	- When inflation is going high, interest rates are increased to curtail the purchasing power of individuals, limiting demands, and thus lowering prices.
- A **good credit score is crucial** and is calculated based on many factors like payment history, types of credit, amount of credit, etc.
- **Credit card rates are given in APR** (Annual Percentage Rate), however, it may be compounded monthly or daily, leading to an **higher effective APR than written APR**.
- A **credit card may have different types of APRs** - purchase APR, the cash advance APR, penalty AR, promotional APR, etc.
- **Credit card interest is calculated using Daily Average Balance** and changed for the entire period - **beginning with the first date** for which the statement is generated. For instance, for an unpaid statement from 1 Oct to 1 Nov, interest will be charged from 1 Oct if not paid by the grace period.
- A fee for credit card transactions is charged by the network (generally 1/1000), the issuing bank, and the acquiring bank.
- **Avoid payday loans** - exorbitant interest rates in the likes of 650%.
- Always **use the high-interest rate method to eliminate debt** in life - avoid using the snowball method which is psychologically more soothing as it eliminates the number of debts.
- Bankruptcy helps get free from the cycle of debt, however comes at the cost of reflection in credit score for, maybe, decades.
	- Not all types of loans are forgiven under bankruptcy.
	- A reorganization may be more desirable instead of forgiving a loan and is less costly on the credit score.

> **Debt and credit should be avoided and paid in as early as possible - if an expenditure is not for survival, use savings instead of credit.**

## [Investments And Retirement](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-investment-vehicles-insurance-and-retirement)
**Disclaimer: The below summary is to give a general idea of investment and retirement instruments - the facts may not be totally correct and applicable in countries other than USA.**

- Invest in retirement based schemes to save taxes - the only drawback (if considered as one) is it's illiquidity, i.e. liquidation may be not possible and attract penalty.
- Withdrawing from IRA attracts tax deduction in the current tax slab and not the one when the money was invested.
- In some retirement schemes, taxes are asked upfront - so it is important to make estimations on which one will be better for us.
- Some retirement vehicles (eg. 401(k) in USA) may be managed and matched by the employer - a drawback could be that the investment options in such schemes may be limited.
- Don't be selfish relative to your older self and withdraw money from retirement savings unless absolutely necessary.
- Keep simplicity in life - one retirement scheme so it is easier to manage.
- The earlier I start saving for retirement, the more flexibility I'll have with retirement and more time the money will have to compound on itself.
- Close-ended mutual funds can only be traded in secondary markets after their NFO.
- Exchange Traded Funds are, loosely saying, a combination of close-ended and open-ended mutual funds.
	- Usually big corporations buy large shares of the ETF and then sell small shares to individual investors.
	- Usually ETFs have lower management fees due to less frequent inflow and outflow of money to the AMC.
- Shares make an individual partial owner of the company, bonds make one partial lender to a company.
- Securities relating to equity are stocks, while bonds are securities relating to debt.
- Term life insurance is limited to a term while whole life insurance is for the whole life till I die.

> **Having money make money and emergencies convered (death, disability, loss of job, etc.) provide genuine financial freedom.**

## [Income And Benefits](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/income)
- From salary, deductions are made by law and then voluntary deductions - these maybe on a pre-tax basis and hence help in saving taxes.
	- By law deductions are generally tax, social security related schemes, compulsory insurances, etc.
	- Voluntary deductions may include charity, automated savings, employer benefits, etc.
- The more allowances we've, there are more withholding and eligible for more tax refund and benefits.
- More allowances lead to lesser amount in paycheck and thereafter lesser flexibility in how I spend the rest that I get in hand.
- Be mindful of all the perks and benefits that a job offers and not just the apparent CTC or in-hand salary. For instance, having lunch in office can lead to compounding savings in the long run.
	- Other benefits may include health insurance, matching for retirement, travel allowance, etc.
	- Do not underestimate the savings incurred through these benefits - it's easy to overlook since they are not in numbers.

> **It is important to understand - there is always more to earning than just the paycheck.**

## [Buying vs Renting A House](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-housing)
- In general in a mortgage, initially, a larger portion of the monthly payment goes towards paying the interest. Towards the end, it goes heavily to the principal.
- Always analyze the out-of-pocket costs of renting vs buying any commodity.
- Don't forget to take into consideration the intangible aspects (such as sense of security, mental peace that rent price fluctuations will not matter, maintainance headache, etc.) of buying vs renting.
- A thumb rule is to allocate 30% of gross income to housing, utilities, insurance, bill, etc.
- In addition to rent take into account involved monthly expenses when moving out or renting.
- Interest paid for the house is the money being burned.
- When deciding on whether to rent or buy, take into consideration the appreciation or depreciation of housing.
- Not the whole mortgage but interest is tax-deductible i.e. no tax on the interest amount.
- There are multiple different types of mortgages. Research is very important before committing.
- There can be dynamic interest rate loans depending on some index plus some premium.
- The credit score is extremely important in the long run for taking a loan and its interest rate.
- Foreclosure affects credit score badly. Hence, in cases of short-sale, it is better to sell and pay to the bank instead of defaulting.
- Even short-sale may affect credit score and the waived off loan amount may be considered as income for taxation.
- In a loan or any other debt, consider all sorts of charges (for instance closing fees, paperwork charges, etc.) instead of just the straightforward interest.
- Possession is not always equal to ownership.
- The legal documents related to ownership are called deeds.
- Title insurances protect against random happenings or mishaps to a clean title claim.
- Escrow is a trusted third party that acts as a bucket and releases assets as each party completes their obligation.
- Even when people are laid off or salary depreciates, the economy may go up by spending due to appreciation in real estate.

> **It is not a black and white when it comes to renting vs buying, context and research is of utmost importance.**

## [Buying vs Leasing](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-auto)
- Do calculation for commodities to understand cost of buying vs leasing.
- Take into consideration as many factors as possible - investing the saved money, tax benefits, resale value, etc.
- Find resale value based on research and past depreciation.

> **Leasing or buying has a huge consideration of whether we want to keep the commodity in the long run or not.**

## [Personal Taxes Overview](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-taxes)
> The overview is from a US tax system point of view.

- Tax deductions happen from the income to be taxed.
- Itemized deduction may be lower or higher than the standard deduction.
- Only one - itemized or standard deduction - may be chosen.
- Alternative Minimum Taxes or regular taxes - the maximum of the two needs to be paid.
- AMT is almost flat rate without any deductions.
- AMT is usually larger compared to regular taxes for people with lots of deductions or very high income.
- Estate tax (AKA inheritance tax and death tax) is charged on the property left behind on death.
- Each country has some sort of progressive income tax system.
- The progressive tax system works in the following manner: first 10,000 at X%, next 10,000 at Y%, and so on. Here, X and Y are tax rate for the 0-10,000 and 10,000-20,000 tax brackets.
- The tax bracket calculation is done on the taxable income, i.e. after removing the deductions.
- A tax credit is directly subtracted from the taxes (unlike deductions).
- Gross income includes all the income for the financial year.
- On gross income, over-the-line deductions are made to get adjusted gross income.
- On AGI, deductions, and exemptions are subtracted to get the taxable income and eventually taxes.
- Having dependents allows for claiming exemptions related to dependents.

> **Tax systems are complex. Though once understood, lot of money may be saved with little effort.**

## [Paying For College](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-paying-for-college)
> The ideas are general though have been taken from the US college and financial aid system.

- Most of the colleges, especially elite colleges offer adequate financial aids.
- Never use emergency funds or retirement funds for college.
- Explore and research all avenues of financial aid.
- Assess if the prospected job or salary will be able to repay loans.
- A lot of factors are taken into consideration when deciding eligibility for financial aid.
- Every little bit helps when saving for a college or saving in general.
- There are broadly two types of scholarships - merit-based and need-based.
- The more specific a scholarship is, the higher are the chances of getting it.
- Student loans are of different types and it's important to look through al.
- Sometimes for some loans a deferment is possible.
- Restructuring and rebalancing loans can help in saving money and time.
- Financial aid package can be appealed for a review and should be done immediately.
- Always keep in mind the opportunity cost of taking up graduation or study in general.

> **College can be one of the best investments if done wisely.**
